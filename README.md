# Analysing Internal Compaints in the Chicaco Police Departnemt
We analyze misconduct complaints filed by police officers, using open-source data provided by the Invisible Institute.

In the database, most records are for misconduct allegations filed by civilians against police officers. But there is also a significant number of anonymous complaints filed internally by officers against other officers. We look at these internal complaints to address several questions:
- Within a unit, does the rate of internal complaints indicate accountability?
- Do internal complaints have a greater impact than civilian-filed complaints on individual officers? 
- Are internal complaints on an officer predictive of future civilian complaints?
